# Tinyfoot Project

## Overview
This project is a minimalist rework of the original Bigfoot.js, named Tinyfoot. The primary features include:
- Total and unread footnote tracking
- Footnote buttons change color upon being read (to green)
- Lightweight and focused on core footnote interaction

## Features
- **Default Behavior**: Footnote buttons start as "unread."
- **Unread Footnote Count**: Dynamically updates as users interact with footnotes.
- **Visual Feedback**: Buttons turn green when read.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Place the files in `/src` and `/dist`.
3. Run the HTML file from the `/demo` directory to see Tinyfoot in action.

## Future Improvements
- Add more interactive footnote styles.
- Expand compatibility with more frameworks.
